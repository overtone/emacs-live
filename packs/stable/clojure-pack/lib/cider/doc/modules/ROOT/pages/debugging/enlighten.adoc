= Enlighten
:experimental:

Enlighten Mode displays the value of locals in realtime, as your code
runs. This feature is somewhat similar to a feature in the Light Table
editor.

To turn it on, issue kbd:[M-x] `cider-enlighten-mode`. Then,
evaluate your functions one at a time using kbd:[C-M-x] or
kbd:[C-x C-e]. Note that kbd:[C-c C-k] won't work.

That's it! Once your code executes, the regular old buffer on the left will turn
into the brilliant show of lights on the right.

To stop displaying the locals you'll have to disable `cider-enlighten-mode`
and reevaluate the definitions you had instrumented previously.

You can also trigger this on specific functions (without having to turn on the
minor mode) by writing `#light` before the `(def` and re-evaluating
it.
