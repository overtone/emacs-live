= Release Policy

We're following http://semver.org/[SemVer] (as much as one can be
following it when the major version is 0). At this point bumps of the
minor (second) version number are considered major releases and always
include new features or significant changes to existing features. API
compatibility between major releases is not a (big) concern (although we try
to break the API rarely and only for a good reason).

The development cycle for the next major
release starts immediately after the previous one has been
shipped. Bugfix/point releases (if any) address only serious bugs and
never contain new features.

Here are a few examples:

* 0.5.0 - Feature release
* 0.5.1 - Bug-fix release
* 0.5.2 - Bug-fix release
* 0.6.0 - Feature release

CIDER and cider-nrepl are released independently, but follow the same release policy overall.
CIDER contains references to the cider-nrepl version it supports and would normally inject
the newest cider-nrepl version possible.
