= Release Policy

We're following http://semver.org/[SemVer].

NOTE: Prior to CIDER 1.0, bumps of the minor (second) version number
were considered major releases (e.g. 0.25 and 0.26 were major
releases).

The development cycle for the next major
release starts immediately after the previous one has been
shipped. Bugfix/point releases (if any) address only serious bugs and
never contain new features or public API changes.

Here are a few examples:

* 1.1.0 - Feature release
* 1.1.1 - Bug-fix release
* 1.1.2 - Bug-fix release
* 1.2.0 - Feature release

CIDER and cider-nrepl are released independently, but follow the same release policy overall.footnote:[Keep in mind, though, that cider-nrepl has yet to make it to version 1.0]
CIDER contains references to the cider-nrepl version it supports and would normally inject
the newest cider-nrepl version possible.

Commands that were made obsolete will be removed in the next major release.
