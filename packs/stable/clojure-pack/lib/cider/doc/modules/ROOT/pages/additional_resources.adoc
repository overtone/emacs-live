= Additional Resources

Here we're collecting external resources on CIDER that are complementary to the
user's manual. Please, keep in mind that as CIDER is constantly evolving, some
of those resources might be out-of-date by the time you get to them.

NOTE: Feel free to submit any useful CIDER resources that you've come across.

== Quick reference

A single-page quick reference PDF for CIDER commands is available
https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/refcard/cider-refcard.pdf[here]. This PDF can be created manually by running
`pdflatex` on https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/blob/master/refcard/cider-refcard.tex[the CIDER refcard LaTeX file].
