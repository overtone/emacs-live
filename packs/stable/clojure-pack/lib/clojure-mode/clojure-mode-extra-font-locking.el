;; Version: 3.0.0
;; Keywords: languages, lisp
;; Package-Requires: ((clojure-mode "3.0"))

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides additional font-locking for clojure-mode.  This font-locking
;; used to be part of clojure-mode up to version 3.0, but it was removed
;; due to its unreliable nature (the implementation is quite primitive
;; and font-locks symbols without any regard for what they resolve to).
;; CIDER provides much more reliable font-locking, that's based on the runtime
;; state of your Clojure application.
