;;; Commentary:

;; This is a script to be loaded while visiting a `clojure-mode' source file.
;; It will prepare all requirements and then byte-compile the file and signal an
;; error on any warning.  For example:
;;
;;    emacs -Q --batch -l test/clojure-mode-bytecomp-warnings.el clojure-mode.el

;; This assumes that all `clojure-mode' dependencies are already on the package
;; dir (probably from running `cask install').
