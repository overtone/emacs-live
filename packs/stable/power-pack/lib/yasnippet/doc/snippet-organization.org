#+TITLE: Organizing snippets

* Basic structure

   Snippet collections can be stored in plain text files. They are arranged by
   sub-directories naming *snippet tables*. These mostly name Emacs major names.

   #+begin_example
   .
   |-- c-mode
   |   `-- printf
   |-- java-mode
   |   `-- println
   `-- text-mode
       |-- email
       `-- time
   #+end_example

   The collections are loaded into *snippet tables* which the
   triggering mechanism (see [[file:snippet-expansion.org][Expanding Snippets]]) looks up and
   (hopefully) causes the right snippet to be expanded for you.

* Setting up =yas-snippet-dirs=

   The emacs variable [[sym:yas-snippet-dirs][=yas-snippet-dirs=]] tells YASnippet
   which collections to consider. It's used when you activate
   [[sym:yas-global-mode][=yas-global-mode=]] or call
   [[sym:yas-reload-all][=yas-reload-all=]] interactively.

   The default considers:

    - a personal collection that lives in =~/.emacs.d/snippets=
    - the bundled collection, taken as a relative path to =yasnippet.el= localtion

   When you come across other snippet collections, do the following to try them
   out:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
   ;; Develop in ~/emacs.d/mysnippets, but also
   ;; try out snippets in ~/Downloads/interesting-snippets
   (setq yas-snippet-dirs '("~/emacs.d/mysnippets"
                              "~/Downloads/interesting-snippets"))

   ;; OR, keeping YASnippet defaults try out ~/Downloads/interesting-snippets
   (setq yas-snippet-dirs (append yas-snippet-dirs
                                  '("~/Downloads/interesting-snippets")))
   #+end_src

   Collections appearing earlier in the list shadow snippets with same names
   appearing in collections later in the list. [[sym:yas-new-snippet][=yas-new-snippet=]] always stores
   snippets in the first collection.

* The =.yas-parents= file

   It's very useful to have certain modes share snippets between
   themselves. To do this, choose a mode subdirectory and place a
   =.yas-parents= containing a whitespace-separated list of other mode
   names. When you reload those modes become parents of the original
   mode.

   #+begin_example
   .
   |-- c-mode
   |   |-- .yas-parents    # contains "cc-mode text-mode"
   |   `-- printf
   |-- cc-mode
   |   |-- for
   |   `-- while
   |-- java-mode
   |   |-- .yas-parents    # contains "cc-mode text-mode"
   |   `-- println
   `-- text-mode
       |-- email
       `-- time
   #+end_example


* TODO The =.yas-make-groups= file

   If you place an empty plain text file =.yas-make-groups= inside one
   of the mode directories, the names of these sub-directories are
   considered groups of snippets and [[snippet-menu.org][the menu]] is organized much more
   cleanly:

   [[./images/menu-groups.png]]

   Another way to achieve this is to place a =# group:= directive
   inside the snippet definition. See [[./snippet-development.org][Writing Snippets]].

   #+begin_example
   $ tree ruby-mode/
   ruby-mode/
   |-- .yas-make-groups
   |-- collections
   |   |-- each
   |   `-- ...
   |-- control structure
   |   |-- forin
   |   `-- ...
   |-- definitions
   |   `-- ...
   `-- general
      `-- ...
   #+end_example

   Yet another way to create a nice snippet menu is to write into
   =.yas-make-groups= a menu definition. TODO
