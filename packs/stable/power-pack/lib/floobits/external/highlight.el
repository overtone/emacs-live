;;(@* "Library `facemenu+.el' Puts Highlight on the Menu")
;;  ** Library `facemenu+.el' Puts Highlight on the Menu **
;;
;;  If you load library `facemenu+.el' after you load library
;;  `highlight.el', then the commands defined here will also be
;;  available on a Highlight submenu in the Text Properties menus.
;;
;;(@* "User Option `hlt-use-overlays-flag'")
;;  ** User Option `hlt-use-overlays-flag'
;;
;;  You can highlight text in two ways using this library, depending
;;  on the value of user option `hlt-use-overlays-flag':
;;
;;   - non-nil means to highlight using overlays
;;   - nil means to highlight using text properties
;;
;;  Overlays are independent from the text itself.  They are not
;;  picked up when you copy and paste text.  By default, highlighting
;;  uses overlays.
;;
;;  Although highlighting recognizes only nil and non-nil values for
;;  `hlt-use-overlays-flag', other actions can have different
;;  behavior, depending on the non-nil value.  If it is `only' (the
;;  default value), then only overlay highlighting is affected.  If it
;;  is any other non-nil value, then both overlay highlighting and
;;  text-property highlighting are effected.  This is the case, for
;;  instance, for unhighlighting and for navigating among highlights.
;;
;;  For example, for unhighlighting, if `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is
;;  non-nil, then overlay highlighting is removed.  If it is not
;;  `only', then text-property highlighting is removed.  A value of
;;  nil thus removes both overlays and text properties.
;;
;;  Keep this sensitivity to the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag' in
;;  mind.  For example, if you change the value after adding some
;;  highlighting, then that highlighting might not be removed by
;;  unhighlighting, unless you change the value back again.
;;
;;  You can toggle the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag' at any time
;;  between nil and its previous non-nil value, using command
;;  `hlt-toggle-use-overlays-flag'.
;;
;;(@* "Temporary or Permanent Highlighting")
;; ** "Temporary or Permanent Highlighting" **
;;
;;  Generally, highlighting you add is temporary: it is not saved when
;;  you write your buffer todisk.  However, Emacs has a curious and
;;  unfamiliar feature called "formatted" or "enriched" text mode,
;;  which does record highlighting permanently.  See the Emacs manual,
;;  node `Requesting Formatted Text'.
;;
;;  To save highlighting permanently, do the following:
;;
;;  1. `M-x enriched-mode', to put your file buffer in minor mode
;;     `enriched-mode'.  You will see `Enriched' in the mode line.
;;
;;  2. Choose text-property highlighting, not overlay highlighting, by
;;     setting option `hlt-use-overlays-flag' to `nil'.  To do this
;;     using Customize, choose menu item `Highlight using text
;;     properties, not overlays'.
;;
;;  3. Choose the highlight face to use:
;;     `M-x hlt-choose-default-face'.
;;
;;  4. Highlight in any way provided by library `highlight.el'.  For
;;     example, use `hlt-highlighter' (personally, I bind it to `C-x
;;     mouse-2') to drag-highlight as if using a marker pen.
;;
;;  5. Save your file.
;;
;;     Note that, although highlighting in enriched-text mode modifies
;;     the buffer, it does not appear modified (check the beginning of
;;     the mode line), so if you make no other changes then using `C-x
;;     C-s' will not save your highlighting changes.  To remedy this,
;;     just do something besides highlighting - e.g., add a space and
;;     delete it - so that `C-x C-s' will save to disk.
;;
;;  When you reopen your file later, it will automatically be in
;;  enriched mode, and your highlighting will show.  However, be aware
;;  that font-locking interferes with enriched mode, so you will
;;  probably want to use it on files where you don't use font-locking.
;;
;;(@* "Commands")
;;  ** Commands **
;;
;;  You can use any face to highlight, and you can apply a mouse face
;;  instead of a face, if you like.  A mouse face shows up only when
;;  the mouse pointer is over it.
;;
;;  The commands you will use the most often are probably
;;  `hlt-highlight', `hlt-highlighter', `hlt-next-highlight', and
;;  `hlt-previous-highlight'.  You might also often use the various
;;  commands to hide and show highlighted text.
;;
;;  You can use command `hlt-highlight' to highlight the region,
;;  highlight a regexp throughout the region, or unhighlight the
;;  region, depending on the prefix argument.  It combines most of the
;;  behavior of commands `hlt-highlight-regexp-region',
;;  `hlt-highlight-region', and `hlt-unhighlight-region'.  Command
;;  `hlt-highlight-regexp-to-end' highlights a regexp from the text
;;  cursor position to the end of the buffer.
;;
;;  Command `hlt-highlighter' lets you highlight text by simply
;;  dragging the mouse, just as you would use a highlighter (marker).
;;  You can thus highlight text the same way that you drag the mouse
;;  to define the region.
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 21 or later, you can use various commands that
;;  highlight and unhighlight text that has certain text properties
;;  with given values.  You can use them to highlight all text in the
;;  region or buffer that has a given property value.  An example is
;;  highlighting all links (text with property `mouse-face').  These
;;  commands are:
;;
;;  `hlt-highlight-all-prop' - Highlight text that has a given
;;                             property with any (non-nil) value.
;;
;;  `hlt-highlight-property-with-value' - Highlight text that has a
;;                             given property with certain values.
;;
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-all-prop' - Unhighlight highlighted propertized
;;                             text.
;;
;;  `hlt-mouse-toggle-link-highlighting' - Alternately highlight and
;;                             unhighlight links on a mouse click.
;;
;;  `hlt-toggle-link-highlighting' - Alternately highlight and
;;                             unhighlight links.
;;
;;  `hlt-mouse-toggle-property-highlighting' - Alternately highlight
;;                             and unhighlight propertized text on a
;;                             mouse click.
;;
;;  `hlt-toggle-property-highlighting' - Alternately highlight and
;;                             unhighlight propertized text.
;;
;;  As always for library `highlight.el', this "highlighting" can use
;;  property `mouse-face' instead of `face'.  You could, for example,
;;  highlight, using `mouse-face', all text that has property `foo' -
;;  or that has property `face', for that matter.
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 21 or later, you can use commands
;;  `hlt-next-highlight' and `hlt-previous-highlight' to navigate
;;  among highlights of a given face.
;;
;;  You can unhighlight the region using command
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-region' (or using `C--' with `hlt-highlight').
;;  If you use overlay highlighting, then you can use command
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-region-for-face' to unhighlight the region for an
;;  individual highlighting face - other highlighting faces remain.
;;
;;  You can replace a highlighting face in the region by another,
;;  using command `hlt-replace-highlight-face'.  With a prefix
;;  argument, property `mouse-face' is used, not property `face'.
;;
;;  Command `hlt-eraser' lets you delete highlighting by dragging the
;;  mouse.  However, its behavior is different for overlays and text
;;  properties - see the `hlt-eraser' doc string.
;;
;;(@* "Copy and Yank (Paste) Text Properties")
;;  ** Copy and Yank (Paste) Text Properties **
;;
;;  You can highlight or unhighlight text by simply copying existing
;;  highlighting (or lack of any highlighting) from anywhere in Emacs
;;  and yanking (pasting) it anywhere else.
;;
;;  Put differently, you can copy and yank a set of text properties.
;;  You can use these commands to copy and yank any text properties,
;;  not just `face' or `mouse-face'.
;;
;;  To copy the text properties at a given position, use command
;;  `hlt-copy-props'.  You can then use command `hlt-yank-props' to
;;  yank those properties to the active region anywhere.  If the set
;;  of properties that you copy is empty, then yanking means
;;  effectively removing all text properties.
;;
;;  User option `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' controls which text
;;  properties to copy and yank, by default.  The default value of the
;;  option includes only `face', which means that only property `face'
;;  is copied and pasted.  That is typically what you want, for
;;  highlighting purposes.  A value of `t' for
;;  `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' means use all properties.
;;
;;  You can further control which text properties are copied or yanked
;;  when you use the commands, by using a prefix argument.  A plain or
;;  non-negative prefix arg means copy or yank all available text
;;  properties.  A negative prefix arg (e.g. `C--') means you are
;;  prompted for which text properties to use, among those available.
;;
;;  For copying, the available properties are those among
;;  `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' that are also present at the copy
;;  position.  For yanking, the available properties are those among
;;  `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' that have previously (last) been
;;  copied.
;;
;;(@* "User Option `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag'")
;;  ** User Option `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag' **
;;
;;  Library `highlight' generally acts only on faces that it controls,
;;  that is, faces that you have explicitly asked it to use for
;;  highlighting.  It sets the text property or overlay property
;;  `hlt-highlight' on such highlighted text, so that it can recognize
;;  which faces it has responsibility for.
;;
;;  Sometimes, you might want to hide and show text other than that
;;  controlled by library `highlight'.  Similarly, you might sometimes
;;  want to navigate among faces other than those used for
;;  highlighting.  You can control this using option
;;  `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag', which you can toggle at any time using
;;  command `hlt-toggle-act-on-any-face-flag'.
;;
;;(@* "Hiding and Showing Text")
;;  ** Hiding and Showing Text **
;;
;;  You can hide and show text that you have highlighted.  You will
;;  want to read the Emacs-Lisp manual (Elisp), section Invisible
;;  Text, to understand better what this entails.  In particular, you
;;  should understand that for library `highlight.el', hiding text
;;  means adding the symbol naming the face to be hidden to both:
;;
;;  1. a text or overlay `invisible' property, making the text or
;;     overlay susceptible to being hidden by buffer-local variable
;;     `buffer-invisibility-spec', and
;;
;;  2. the buffer's `buffer-invisibility-spec', so that it in fact
;;     becomes hidden.
;;
;;  After text has been hidden this way, and unless the highlighting
;;  has been removed completely by unhighlighting the text, the
;;  `invisible' property of that text keeps the names of the faces
;;  that have been applied to that text and hidden previously, even
;;  after you show that text again.  Showing a hidden face simply
;;  removes it from the `buffer-invisibility-spec'; it does not change
;;  any `invisible' properties.
;;
;;  For example, if you hide face `foo' at some buffer position:
;;
;;  1. The `invisible' property of the text or overlay at that
;;     position is updated to include `foo'.  If there are no other
;;     faces that have been applied to this text and then hidden, the
;;     `invisible' property is just `(foo)'.
;;
;;  2. `buffer-invisibility-spec' is also updated to include `foo'.
;;     This hides all text properties and overlay properties with
;;     `invisible' property `foo', throughout the buffer.  If there
;;     are no other invisible faces in the buffer, then
;;     `buffer-invisibility-spec' has value (foo).
;;
;;  If you then show face `foo' at that same buffer position, there is
;;  no change to the `invisible' property.  `buffer-invisibility-spec'
;;  is updated, by removing `foo': if it was (foo), it becomes ().
;;
;;  There are several commands for hiding and showing highlighted
;;  text.  The basic commands for hiding and showing are
;;  `hlt-hide-default-face' and `hlt-show-default-face', which you can
;;  use to hide and show the face last used for highlighting.  With a
;;  prefix argument, you are prompted for a different face to hide; it
;;  then becomes the default face for highlighting.  You can also
;;  change the default highlighting face at any time using command
;;  `hlt-choose-default-face'.
;;
;;(@* "Hiding and Showing Text - Icicles Multi-Commands")
;;  *** Hiding and Showing Text - Icicles Multi-Commands ***
;;
;;  The other hide and show commands depend on your also using
;;  Icicles, which is a set of libraries that offer enhanced
;;  completion.  Complete information about Icicles is here:
;;  `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles'.  You can obtain Icicles
;;  here: `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles_-_Libraries'.
;;
;;  The Icicles commands defined for `highlight.el' are the following:
;;
;;  `icicle-choose-faces', `icicle-choose-invisible-faces',
;;  `icicle-choose-visible-faces', `icicle-hide-faces',
;;  `icicle-hide-only-faces', `icicle-show-faces',
;;  `icicle-show-only-faces'.
;;
;;  These are all Icicles multi-commands, which means that they each
;;  let you choose multiple completion candidates or all candidates
;;  that match your current input (a regexp).  To use them you must
;;  also use Icicles.  You can use command `icicle-hide-faces' to hide
;;  any number of visible faces.  Any text is hidden that has that
;;  face as a text property or an overlay property, depending on the
;;  value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-show-faces' is the opposite of
;;  `icicle-hide-faces': it shows invisible text that has the faces
;;  you choose.  Neither `icicle-hide-faces' nor `icicle-show-faces'
;;  has any effect on other faces, besides those you choose to hide or
;;  show, respectively; they each do only one thing, hide or show.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-hide-only-faces' hides the faces you choose, and
;;  shows all other faces, and command `icicle-show-only-faces' does
;;  the opposite.  You can thus use these commands to specify exactly
;;  what faces should be invisible and visible.  Empty input means
;;  none: If you choose no faces to hide (that is, hit `RET' with an
;;  empty minibuffer), then all faces will be made visible; if you
;;  choose no faces to show, then all will be hidden.
;;
;;  Currently, face attributes for highlighting are combined when
;;  overlays overlap, but the same is not true for text properties.
;;  For example, if you highlight a word with face `foo', and then you
;;  highlight it with face `bar', only `bar' remains as the face for
;;  that word.  With overlays, the attributes of the two faces are
;;  composed.  When you hide or show faces, this behavior difference
;;  has an effect.
;;
;;  You can hide text using the commands in this library for any of
;;  the purposes that you might use invisible text in Emacs.  This
;;  gives you an easy, interactive way to control which sections of
;;  text are seen by search and other Emacs tools.  Use the regexp
;;  highlighting commands, for instance, to highlight text
;;  syntactically, and then hide that highlighted text.  Or use
;;  `hlt-highlighter' to sweep over text that you want to hide with
;;  the mouse.
;;
;;  Hiding and showing faces also provides a "conditional text"
;;  feature similar to that available in desktop publishing
;;  applications such as Adobe Framemaker.  Publishers often use such
;;  a feature to produce different output documents from the same
;;  source document ("single sourcing").  You can use this feature
;;  similarly, if you have an application (printing is one example)
;;  that is sensitive to whether text is visible or invisible.  One
;;  caveat: Emacs faces are not saved when you save your file.
;;
;;(@* "What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type")
;;  ** What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type **
;;
;;  All mention of the "region" in this commentary should really say
;;  "region or buffer".  If the region is active and non-empty, then
;;  only the text in the region is targeted by the commands in this
;;  library.  This lets you easily control the scope of operations.
;;
;;  If the region is not active or it is empty, then:
;;
;;  - If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is nil and there is no prefix arg,
;;    then the face is applied to the next characters that you type.
;;
;;  - Otherwise, the face is applied to the entire buffer (or the
;;    current restriction, if the buffer is narrowed).
;;
;;(@* "Interference by Font Lock")
;;  ** Interference by Font Lock **
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 22 or later, then you can use this library in
;;  conjunction with library `font-lock+.el'.  That will prevent
;;  font-locking from removing any highlighting face properties that
;;  you apply using the commands defined here.
;;
;;  Otherwise, when `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is nil, font-lock
;;  highlighting will interfere with the highlighting of this library.
;;  In most cases, you will be able to highlight text, but sooner or
;;  later font-lock will erase that highlighting when it refontifies
;;  the buffer.  If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is non-nil, there is no
;;  such problem : font-lock has no effect on overlays.
;;
;;(@* "Suggested Bindings")
;;  ** Suggested Bindings **
;;
;;  This library adds menu items to the Region submenu of the Edit
;;  menu-bar menu, if you have a Region submenu.  To obtain this menu,
;;  load library `menu-bar+.el'.
;;
;;  Otherwise, library `highlight.el' makes no key bindings.  Here are
;;  some suggested bindings (`C-x C-y', `C-x mouse-2', `C-x
;;  S-mouse-2', `C-S-p', and `C-S-n', respectively):
;;
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?y)] 'hlt-highlight)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map [(down-mouse-2)] 'hlt-highlighter)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map [(S-down-mouse-2)] 'hlt-eraser)
;;   (global-set-key [(shift control ?p)]  ; Emacs 21 or later
;;                   'hlt-previous-highlight)
;;   (global-set-key [(shift control ?n)]  ; Emacs 21 or later
;;                   'hlt-next-highlight)
;;
;;  You might also want to bind command `hlt-choose-default-face',
;;  which you can use to change the current default highlighting face.
;;
;;(@* "See Also")
;;  ** See Also **
;;
;;  * `highlight-chars.el' - Provides ways to highlight different sets
;;    of characters, including whitespace and Unicode characters.  It
;;    is available here:

;;    http://www.emacswiki.org/ShowWhiteSpace#HighlightChars   (doc)
;;
;;  * `hi-lock.el' - The features of `highlight.el' are complementary
;;    to those of vanilla Emacs library `hi-lock.el', so you can use
;;    the two libraries together.  See this page for a comparison:
;;    http://www.emacswiki.org/HighlightTemporarily.
;;
;;(@* "Commands That Won't Work in Emacs 20")
;;  ** Commands That Won't Work in Emacs 20 **
;;
;;  The following commands and options work only for Emacs versions
;;  more recent than Emacs 20:
;;
;;  `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag', `hlt-hide-default-face',
;;  `hlt-highlight-property-with-value', `hlt-next-highlight',
;;  `hlt-previous-highlight', `hlt-show-default-face',
;;  `hlt-toggle-act-on-any-face-flag'.
;;
;;(@* "To Do")
;;  ** To Do **
;;
;;  1. Add commands to show and hide boolean combinations of faces.
;;
;;  2. Faces are not accumulated as text properties.
;;     Highlighting with one face completely replaces the previous
;;     highlight.  Overlays don't have this limitation.  Text
;;     properties need not have it either, but they do, for now.

Interactively, FACE is the last face used for highlighting, but
you can use command `hlt-choose-default-face' to choose a different face.

If `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag' is non-nil, then the target face can be
any face you choose.  Otherwise, it must be a face that has been used
for highlighting.

If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is non-nil, then overlay highlighting is
targeted.  If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is not `only', then
text-property highlighting is targeted.  This means, in particular,
that a value of nil targets both overlays and text properties.

If the region is active and not empty, then limit movement to the
region.  Otherwise, use the whole buffer.
When called non-interactively:

 - non-nil argument NO-ERROR-P means do not raise an error if no
   highlight with FACE is found, and leave point at END.

 - Return a cons of the limits of the text starting at point that has
