;;; Go to the end of any of the following lines and run `M-x lively'
;;;   Current time:      (current-time-string)
;;;   Last command:      last-command
;;;   Open buffers:      (length (buffer-list))
;;;   Unix processes:    (lively-shell-command "ps -a | wc -l")

;;; then the code will be replaced by its formatted result -- and

;;; Use `M-x lively-stop' to restore order.
