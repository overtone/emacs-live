;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a more powerful alternative to `ido-mode''s
;; built-in flex matching.

;;; Acknowledgments

;; Scott Frazer's blog entry http://scottfrazersblog.blogspot.com.au/2009/12/emacs-better-ido-flex-matching.html
;; provided a lot of inspiration.
;;
;; ido-hacks was helpful for ido optimization and fontification ideas

;;; Installation:

;; Add the following code to your init file:
;;
;;     (require 'flx-ido)
;;     (ido-mode 1)
;;     (ido-everywhere 1)
;;     (flx-ido-mode 1)
;;     ;; disable ido faces to see flx highlights.
;;     (setq ido-use-faces nil)
