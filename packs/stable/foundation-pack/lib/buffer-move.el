;;; Commentary:

;; This file is for lazy people wanting to swap buffers without
;; typing C-x b on each window. This is useful when you have :

;; +--------------+-------------+
;; |              |             |
;; |    #emacs    |    #gnus    |
;; |              |             |
;; +--------------+-------------+
;; |                            |
;; |           .emacs           |
;; |                            |
;; +----------------------------+

;; and you want to have :

;; +--------------+-------------+
;; |              |             |
;; |    #gnus     |   .emacs    |
;; |              |             |
;; +--------------+-------------+
;; |                            |
;; |           #emacs           |
;; |                            |
;; +----------------------------+

;; With buffer-move, just go in #gnus, do buf-move-left, go to #emacs
;; (which now should be on top right) and do buf-move-down.

;; To use it, simply put a (require 'buffer-move) in your ~/.emacs and
;; define some keybindings. For example, i use :

;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-up>")     'buf-move-up)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-down>")   'buf-move-down)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-left>")   'buf-move-left)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<C-S-right>")  'buf-move-right)


;;; Code:


(require 'windmove)


;;;###autoload
(defun buf-move-up ()
  "Swap the current buffer and the buffer above the split.
If there is no split, ie now window above the current one, an
error is signaled."
;;  "Switches between the current buffer, and the buffer above the
;;  split, if possible."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((other-win (windmove-find-other-window 'up))
         (buf-this-buf (window-buffer (selected-window))))
    (if (null other-win)
        (error "No window above this one")
      ;; swap top with this one
      (set-window-buffer (selected-window) (window-buffer other-win))
      ;; move this one to top
      (set-window-buffer other-win buf-this-buf)
      (select-window other-win))))

;;;###autoload
(defun buf-move-down ()
"Swap the current buffer and the buffer under the split.
