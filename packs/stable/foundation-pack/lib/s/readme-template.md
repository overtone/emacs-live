# s.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el)

The long lost Emacs string manipulation library.

## Installation

It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and [Melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

    M-x package-install s

Or you can just dump `s.el` in your load path somewhere.

## Functions

[[ function-list ]]

## Documentation and examples

[[ function-docs ]]

## What's with the built-in wrappers?

Imagine looking through the function list and seeing `s-ends-with?`, but
`s-starts-with?` is nowhere to be found. Why? Well, because Emacs already has
`string-prefix-p`. Now you're starting out slightly confused, then have to go
somewhere else to dig for the command you were looking for.

The wrapping functions serve as both documentation for existing functions and
makes for a consistent API.

## Other string related libraries

* [inflections](https://github.com/eschulte/jump.el/blob/master/inflections.el) package
provides functions for strings pluralization and singularization.

* [levenshtein](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/levenshtein.el) package provides a function to
calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings.

* [string-utils](https://github.com/rolandwalker/string-utils) is another general string manipulation library.

## Contribute

Yes, please do. Pure functions in the string manipulation realm only,
please. There's a suite of tests in `dev/examples.el`, so remember to add
tests for your function, or I might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/magnars/s.el

Run the tests with

    ./run-tests.sh

Create the docs with

    ./create-docs.sh

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so that
the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` directly, it is auto-generated.
Change `readme-template.md` or `examples-to-docs.el` instead.
