# <img align="right" src="https://raw.github.com/magnars/dash.el/master/rainbow-dash.png"> dash.el

A modern list api for Emacs. No 'cl required.

## Installation

It's available on [GNU ELPA](https://elpa.gnu.org/) and
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install dash

Or you can just dump `dash.el` in your load
path somewhere.

If you want the function combinators, then also:

    M-x package-install dash-functional

## Using in a package

Add this to the big comment block at the top:

    ;; Package-Requires: ((dash "[[ version ]]"))

To get function combinators:

    ;; Package-Requires: ((dash "[[ version ]]") (dash-functional "1.2.0") (emacs "24"))

## Upcoming breaking change!

- For backward compatibility reasons `-zip` return a cons-cell instead of a list
  with two elements when called on two lists. This is a clunky API, and in an
  upcoming 3.0 release of Dash it will always return a list. If you rely on the
  cons-cell return value, use `-zip-pair` instead.  During the 2.x
  release cycle the new API is available as `-zip-lists`.

## Fontification of special variables

Font lock of special Dash variables (`it`, `acc`, etc.) in Emacs Lisp
buffers can optionally be enabled with the autoloaded minor mode
`dash-fontify-mode`.  In older Emacs versions which do not dynamically
detect macros, the minor mode also fontifies Dash macro calls.

To automatically enable the minor mode in all Emacs Lisp buffers, just
call its autoloaded global counterpart `global-dash-fontify-mode`,
either interactively or from your `user-init-file`:

```el
(global-dash-fontify-mode)
```

## Functions

All functions and constructs in the library are prefixed with a dash (-).

There are also anaphoric versions of functions where that makes sense,
prefixed with two dashes instead of one.

While `-map` takes a function to map over the list, you can also use
the anaphoric form with double dashes - which will then be executed
with `it` exposed as the list item. Here's an example:

```el
(-map (lambda (n) (* n n)) '(1 2 3 4)) ;; normal version

(--map (* it it) '(1 2 3 4)) ;; anaphoric version
```

of course the original can also be written like

```el
(defun square (n) (* n n))

(-map 'square '(1 2 3 4))
```

which demonstrates the usefulness of both versions.

## Contribute

Yes, please do. Pure functions in the list manipulation realm only,
please. There's a suite of tests in `dev/examples.el`, so remember to add
tests for your function, or I might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/magnars/dash.el

Run the tests with

    ./run-tests.sh

Create the docs with

    ./create-docs.sh

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so that
the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` directly, it is auto-generated.
Change `readme-template.md` or `examples-to-docs.el` instead.

### From 2.12 to 2.13

- `-let` now supports `&alist` in destructuring.

  [#130](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el/issues/130) in Emacs 24+.

- Added `-each-indexed` and `--each-indexed`.
- Added `-take-last` and `-drop-last`.
