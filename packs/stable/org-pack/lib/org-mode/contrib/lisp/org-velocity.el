;;; Commentary:
;; Org-Velocity.el is an interface for Org inspired by the minimalist
;; notetaking program Notational Velocity. The idea is to let you
;; amass and access brief notes on many subjects with minimal fuss.
;; Each note is an entry in an ordinary Org file.

;; Org-Velocity can be used in two ways: when called outside Org, to
;; store and access notes in a designated bucket file; or, when called
;; inside Org, as a method for navigating any Org file. (Setting the
;; option `org-velocity-always-use-bucket' disables navigation inside
;; Org files by default, although you can still force this behavior by
;; calling `org-velocity-read' with an argument.)

;; Org-Velocity prompts for search terms in the minibuffer. A list of
;; headings of entries whose text matches your search is updated as
;; you type; you can end the search and visit an entry at any time by
;; clicking on its heading.

;; RET displays the results. If there are no matches, Org-Velocity
;; offers to create a new entry with your search string as its
;; heading. If there are matches, it displays a list of results where
;; the heading of each matching entry is hinted with a number or
;; letter; clicking a result, or typing the matching hint, opens the
;; entry for editing in an indirect buffer. 0 forces a new entry; RET
;; reopens the search for editing.

;; You can customize every step in this process, including the search
;; method, completion for search terms, and templates for creating new
;; entries; M-x customize-group RET org-velocity RET to see all the
;; options.

;; Thanks to Richard Riley, Carsten Dominik, Bastien Guerry, and Jeff
;; Horn for their suggestions.
