The text below explains the rules for participating in Org mode
development.

* Org maintenance

Org maintenance is detailed on Worg: see [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-maintenance.html][org-maintenance]].

* Main contribution rules

1. The master git repository is hosted publicly on [[https://savannah.gnu.org][savannah.gnu.org]].

   : git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs/org-mode.git

   This is sufficient to start hacking and to produce patches that can
   easily and consistently be applied to the main repository.

2. People who want to participate to the Org mode development can send
   patches to this address:

   : emacs-orgmode@gnu.org

3. If you are a regular contributor, you can request push access to
   the repository by creating an account on [[https://savannah.gnu.org/account/register.php][savannah.gnu.org]] and by
   [[https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs][joining the Emacs group]].
   
   After you have been added as a user with push privileges, you can
   clone the repository like this:

   : git clone USERNAME@git.savannah.gnu.org:/srv/git/emacs/org-mode.git

   Replace =USERNAME= with your Savannah username.

4. By requesting push access, you acknowledge that you have read and
   agreed with the following rules:

   - Org mode is part of GNU Emacs.  Therefore, we need to be very
     conscious about changes moving into the Org mode core.  These can
     originate only from people who have signed the appropriate papers
     with the Free Software Foundation.  The files to which this
     applies are:

     - all *.el files in the lisp directory of the repository
     - orgcard.tex and all *.org files in the doc/ directory

   - Before making any significant changes, please explain and discuss
     them on the mailing list [[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org][emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]].

     This does obviously not apply to people who are maintaining their
     own contributions to Org mode.  Please just use the new mechanism
     to make sure all changes end up in the right place.

     We value a nice tone in our discussions: please check and respect
     the [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.en.html][GNU Kind Communications Guidelines]].

   - Org mode no longer uses ChangeLog entries to document changes.
     Instead, special commit messages are used, as described in the
     `CONTRIBUTE' file in the main Emacs repository.

   - Among other things, Org mode is widely appreciated because of its
     simplicity, cleanness and consistency.  We should try to preserve
     them and ask everyone to keep this in mind when posting changes.

See [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html][worg/org-contribute]] for guidance on how to contribute effectively.

* The =contrib/= directory

The git repository used to contain a =contrib/= directory.  Files in
this directory were moved to a new [[https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib][org-contrib]] repository before Org
9.5.  You can install the new =org-contrib= from [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/][NonGNU ELPA]].
