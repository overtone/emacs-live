Magit v2.3.1 Release Notes
==========================

Released 11 November 2015 by Jonas Bernoulli.

This is a bugfix release.

* `magit-stash-drop' now shows a message with the hash of the dropped
  stash to make it easier to recover from dropping the wrong stash.

* `magit-revert-buffers' now avoids needlessly connecting to unrelated
  hosts.  It first checks whether a given file is on the same host as
  the repository, and only if that is so it checks whether the file is
  located inside the repository, using `file-in-directory-p', which,
  for Tramp files, requires connecting to the remote host.

* `magit-commit-message-buffer' no longer hangs when a symlink to the
  repository is involved.

This release also contains various documentation fixes and code
clean-ups.
