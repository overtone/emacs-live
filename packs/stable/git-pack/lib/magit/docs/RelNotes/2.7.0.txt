Changes since v2.6.0
--------------------

* Added new popup `magit-subtree-popup' and bound "O" to it.

* Added new popup `magit-branch-config-popup' and made it available
  from the popups `magit-branch-popup', `magit-pull-and-fetch-popup',
  `magit-pull-popup', `magit-fetch-popup', and `magit-push-popup'.

  With a prefix argument it reads a branch to be configured in the
  minibuffer instead of using the current branch.

* Added new option `magit-branch-popup-show-variables', defaulting to
  t to avoid changing key bindings.  When set to nil, no variables are
  displayed directly in the `magit-branch-popup', instead the subpopup
  `magit-branch-config-popup' has to be used.

* Added new popup command `magit-log-buffer-file-popup'.

* Added new command `magit-diff-buffer-file' and new option
  `magit-diff-buffer-file-locked'.  When the value of the option is
  non-nil, the default, then the command uses a dedicated buffer.

* Added new option `magit-log-buffer-file-locked'.  When its value is
  non-nil, the default, then `magit-log-buffer-file' uses a dedicated
  buffer.

* Added new commands `magit-worktree-checkout',
  `magit-worktree-branch', `magit-worktree-delete',
  and `magit-worktree-status'.

* Added new section inserter `magit-insert-worktrees'

* The command `magit-clone' now runs asynchronously, which avoids
  blocking Emacs and allows handling password prompts.

* The command `magit-stage' learned to stage an untracked file while
  leaving its content unstaged (i.e. `git add --intent-to-add') when
  called with a prefix argument.

* The command `magit-reverse' learned to use `--reject' to ensure that
  non-conflicting hunks are applied and that conflicting hunks are put
  into reject files.

* When the command `magit-discard' is used on staged changes, then
  that is done by first reversing the changes in the index and then in
  the working tree.  The second step could fail due to conflicts.  Now
  the `--reject' argument is used, which ensures that non-conflicting
  hunks are applied and that conflicting hunks are put into reject
  files.

* The command `magit-rebase-continue' learned to reuse the old commit
  message as-is when called with a prefix argument.

* In the refs buffer symbolic refs, such as "remotes/origin/HEAD", are
  no longer omitted from the lists of local and remote branches.

This release also contains the fixes described in the v2.6.1 and
v2.6.2 release notes, as well as various other documentation fixes,
code clean-ups, bug fixes, and other small to medium improvements.
