Magit v2.2.1 Release Notes
==========================

Released 24 August 2015 by Jonas Bernoulli.

This is a bugfix release.

* The version strings in the manual were not set to "2.2" when v2.2.0
  was released.

* Some menu bindings were not adjusted when commands were renamed.

* The "next" tag was never shown in the "Tag(s)" header of the status
  buffer.

* Blaming did not abort gracefully when the user killed the buffer.

* Blaming failed on indirect buffers.

* Blaming did not detect when a file was untracked.

* Blaming passed the wrong line range when the file's buffer was
  narrowed.

* `magit-shell-command-topdir' used `magit-git-command' instead of
  `magit-shell-command'.

* `magit-copy-as-kill' added "nil" to the `kill-ring' when there was
  nothing useful to put there.

* `magit-find-file-hook', `magit-find-index-hook',
  `magit-refresh-popup-buffer-hook' were used without being defined
  using `defvar'.

* `magit-format-ref-labels' failed to work around a Git bug, resulting
  in refnames not being colorized when `--simplify-by-decoration' is
  used.

This release also contains various documentation fixes.
