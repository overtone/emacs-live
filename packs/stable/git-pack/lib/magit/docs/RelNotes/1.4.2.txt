Magit v1.4.2 Release Notes
==========================

Released 8 June 2015 by Jonas Bernoulli.

This is a bugfix release.

Changes since v1.4.1
--------------------

 * Automatic revers of file-visiting buffers now works again in Emacs
   version 24.5.  It was broken due to an incompatible change in that
   Emacs release.

 * Git's reflogs sometimes end with bogus entries.  We now work around
   that when listing stashes.
