Magit v1.4.1 Release Notes
==========================

Released 12 April 2015 by Jonas Bernoulli.

This is a bugfix release.

Changes since v1.4.0
--------------------

 * The external library `magit-log-edit.el' is no longer supported.
   If it is still installed, then instruct the user to remove it.

 * The function `magit-maybe-show-setup-instructions' is now run even
   when `magit' has not been loaded by the time `after-init-hook' ran.

 * Invalid `:package-version' keywords in option definitions were
   fixed.  In some cases the value was "2.1.0" instead of "1.4.0".

 * Some unnecessary obsolete-variable definitions were removed.

 * Running tests on Travis CI was fixed.

 * The Makefile, README.md, and release notes received minor fixes
   and cleanup.
