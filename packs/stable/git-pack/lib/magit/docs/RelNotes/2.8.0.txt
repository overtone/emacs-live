Magit v2.8.0 Release Notes

Released 21 August 2016 by Jonas Bernoulli.

We are pleased to announce the release of Magit version 2.8.0,
representing 124 commits by 11 people over 3 months.

Changes since v2.7.0
--------------------

* Added several new functions that are suitable values for
  `magit-display-buffer-function':
  `magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1',
  `magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1',
  `magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-topleft-v1', and
  `magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1'.

* Added new commands `magit-list-repositories' and related new option
  `magit-repolist-columns'.

* Added new commands `magit-list-submodules and related new option
  `magit-submodule-list-columns'.

* Added new command `magit-branch-orphan'.

* Added new command `magit-log-move-to-parent'.

* Added support for globbing in file arguments of diff and log
  commands.

* Added support for showing and copying bad commit identified by git
  bisect.

* Added new option `magit-log-output-coding-system'.

* Added new option `magit-no-message', which can be used to suppress
  certain messages whose usefulness are being disputed.

* Taught `magit-find-file-noselect' and `magit-find-index-noselect' to
  use Emacs' encoding detection, and enable `revert-buffer' to work in
  those buffers.  This makes `magit-ediff-*' commands more useful for
  files with non-standard encoding.

* Taught `magit-insert-bisect-rest' to show the log graph by default.
  The new option `magit-bisect-show-graph' controls this.

* Taught `magit-insert-submodules' to display more information.

* When a refresh causes the previously current hunk section to
  disappear, which happens when it was applied in some way, then we
  attempt to move to a sibling hunk.  When that succeeds, then that is
  now considered a proper move and `magit-section-movement-hook' is
  called, which in turn may cause the current hunk to be recentered.

* In addition to the directory, each member of the value of option
  `magit-repository-directories' can now specify the depth to look for
  repositories inside that directory, overriding the default depth
  specified using the option `magit-repository-directories-depth'.

* Blob visiting buffers can now be reverted, which is useful when they
  visit a reference.

* Command `magit-stage' can now be used outside of Magit buffers.

* Commands that read a branch or commit from the user now also offer
  tags as completion candidates.

* Taught `magit-insert-worktrees' to use relative filenames.

Fixes since v2.7.0
------------------

* Function `magit-get-all' did split multi-line values into multiple
  values.

* Function `magit-subtree-read-prefix' which is used in order to read
  the `--prefix' argument from the subtree popup was missing.

* Command `magit-blame' failed when run in a blob buffer for a file
  located in a subdirectory.

* Command `magit-diff-visit-file' didn't visit a blob when called
  inside a `magit-stash-mode' buffer.

* Command `magit-submodule-add' did not allow picking a path that
  does not exist yet and read the path before the url.

* Command `magit-submodule-setup' did update existing modules, which
  can cause them to become detached.

* Command `magit-popup-describe-function' could create an extra window
  on wide frames.

* Commands `magit-diff-show-or-scroll-{up,down}' failed to scroll
  stash buffers.

* Mode `git-rebase-mode' did not respect the Git variable
  `core.commentChar'.

* Sections in the process buffer sometimes had invalid parent
  sections, causing movement and visibility commands to fail, and
  expected Git errors not to be handled gracefully in some cases.

* Merges where not performed asynchronously, which made it impossible
  to read a passphrase from the user, needed for commit signing.

* In bare repositories tracked files were listed as deleted.

This release also contains typofixes, documentation updates, code
clean-ups, bug fixes, and other small to medium improvements.
