* It's Magit!  A Git Porcelain inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows.  Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursorâ€™s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis.  Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

* Magit v3.2.1 Release Notes

Released 6st August 2021 by Jonas Bernoulli.

I am pleased to announce the release of Magit version 3.2.1.

This is the first release that is available from NonGNU Elpa.  It is
identical to version 3.2.0 except for dependency metadata, which had
to be changed so that this package could be released on NonGNU Elpa.
