Magit v2.6.2 Release Notes
==========================

Changes since v2.6.1
--------------------

* Added new section inserter `magit-insert-submodules'.  For each
  submodule it inserts the module path and a description of its tip.

* When re-adding an already configured but for some reason unstaged
  submodule, then `magit-submodule-add' now offers the configured
  submodule name as default choice.

Fixes since v2.6.1
------------------

* When possible `git merge (--no-commit|--edit)' perform fast-forward
  merges, which isn't what one would expect.  `magit-merge-nocommit'
  and `magit-merge-editmsg' now work around that by always using
  `--no-ff'.

* The command `magit-log', when called with `--patch' but without
  `--graph', deleted the first two characters of file names in the
  diff.

* When performing an instant fixup/squash, the rebase often failed
  because the commit process still held the lock on `index.lock'.

* The command `magit-submodule-add' offered an invalid default choice
  for the module path and allowed selecting a file that isn't a
  repository.

* `git-rebase-mode' failed to prevent `save-place-mode' from having an
  effect.

* The section inserter `magit-insert-unpulled-from-upstream-or-recent'
  failed to insert the recent commits instead when no upstream is
  configured.

* Two key bindings in `magit-pull-and-fetch-popup' conflicted.

* The default value for `magit-cygwin-mount-points' checked if
  "git.exe" was a cygwin flavor of git, instead of the (possibly user
  customized) value of `magit-git-executable'.
