;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This code allows you to grab either the current selected items, or
;; the frontmost url in various mac appliations, and insert them as
;; hyperlinks into the current org-mode document at point.
;;
;; This code is heavily based on, and indeed requires,
;; org-mac-message.el written by John Weigley and Christopher
;; Suckling.
;;
;; Detailed comments for each application interface are inlined with
;; the code. Here is a brief overview of how the code interacts with
;; each application:
;;
;; Finder.app - grab links to the selected files in the frontmost window
;; Mail.app - grab links to the selected messages in the message list
;; AddressBook.app - Grab links to the selected addressbook Cards
;; Firefox.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Vimperator/Firefox.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Safari.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Google Chrome.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Together.app - Grab links to the selected items in the library list
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; add (require 'org-mac-link-grabber) to your .emacs, and optionally
;; bind a key to activate the link grabber menu, like this:
;;
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;   (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "C-c g") 'omlg-grab-link)))
;;
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Type C-c g (or whatever key you defined, as above), or type M-x
;; omlg-grab-link RET to activate the link grabber. This will present
;; you with a menu to choose an application from which to grab a link
;; to insert at point. You may also type C-g to abort.
;;
;; Customizing:
;;
;; You may customize which applications appear in the grab menu by
;; customizing the group org-mac-link-grabber. Changes take effect
;; immediately.

;; Handle links from Firefox.app
;;
;; This code allows you to grab the current active url from the main
;; Firefox.app window, and insert it as a link into an org-mode
;; document. Unfortunately, firefox does not expose an applescript
;; dictionary, so this is necessarily introduces some limitations.
;;
;; The applescript to grab the url from Firefox.app uses the System
;; Events application to give focus to the firefox application, select
;; the contents of the url bar, and copy it. It then uses the title of
;; the window as the text of the link. There is no way to grab links
;; from other open tabs, and further, if there is more than one window
;; open, it is not clear which one will be used (though emperically it
;; seems that it is always the last active window).
