Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

With optional prefix argument TODO-ONLY, only consider entries that are
TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.

variable `org-agenda-entry-types'.

The call in the diary file should look like this:

all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:

If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default value
of `org-agenda-entry-types' is used: (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp).
So the example above may also be written as

   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)

belonging to the \"Work\" category.

ARGS are symbols indicating what kind of entries to consider.
By default `org-agenda-to-appt' will use :deadline*, :scheduled*
\(i.e., deadlines and scheduled items with a hh:mm specification)

Replace the table field value at the cursor by the result of a calculation.

This function makes use of Dave Gillespie's Calc package, in my view the
most exciting program ever written for GNU Emacs.  So you need to have Calc
installed in order to use this function.

In a table, this command replaces the value in the current field with the
result of a formula.  It also installs the formula as the \"current\" column
formula, by storing it in a special line below the table.  When called
with a `C-u' prefix, the current field must be a named field, and the
formula is installed as valid in only this specific field.

When called with two `C-u' prefixes, insert the active equation
for the field back into the current field, so that it can be
edited there.  This is useful in order to use \\[org-table-show-reference]
to check the referenced fields.

When called, the command first prompts for a formula, which is read in
the minibuffer.  Previously entered formulas are available through the
history list, and the last used formula is offered as a default.
These stored formulas are adapted correctly when moving, inserting, or
deleting columns with the corresponding commands.

The formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Calc package.
For details, see the Org-mode manual.

This function can also be called from Lisp programs and offers
additional arguments: EQUATION can be the formula to apply.  If this
argument is given, the user will not be prompted.  SUPPRESS-ALIGN is
used to speed-up recursive calls by by-passing unnecessary aligns.
SUPPRESS-CONST suppresses the interpretation of constants in the
formula, assuming that this has been done already outside the function.
SUPPRESS-STORE means the formula should not be stored, either because
it is already stored, or because it is a modified equation that should
not overwrite the stored one.

PARAMS is a property list of parameters that can influence the conversion.
A third optional argument BACKEND can be used to convert the content of
the cells using a specific export back-end.

For the generic converter, some parameters are obligatory: you need to
specify either :lfmt, or all of (:lstart :lend :sep).

Valid parameters are:

:splice     When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap
            them into :tstart and :tend.  Default is nil.  When :splice
            is non-nil, this also means that the exporter should not look
            for and interpret header and footer sections.

:hline      String to be inserted on horizontal separation lines.
            May be nil to ignore hlines.

:sep        Separator between two fields
:remove-nil-lines Do not include lines that evaluate to nil.

Each in the following group may be either a string or a function
of no arguments returning a string:

:tstart     String to start the table.  Ignored when :splice is t.
:tend       String to end the table.  Ignored when :splice is t.
:lstart     String to start a new table line.
:llstart    String to start the last table line, defaults to :lstart.
:lend       String to end a table line
:llend      String to end the last table line, defaults to :lend.

Each in the following group may be a string, a function of one
argument (the field or line) returning a string, or a plist
mapping columns to either of the above:

:lfmt       Format for entire line, with enough %s to capture all fields.
            If this is present, :lstart, :lend, and :sep are ignored.
:llfmt      Format for the entire last line, defaults to :lfmt.
:fmt        A format to be used to wrap the field, should contain
            %s for the original field value.  For example, to wrap
            everything in dollars, you could use :fmt \"$%s$\".
            This may also be a property list with column numbers and
            formats.  For example :fmt (2 \"$%s$\" 4 \"%s%%\")
:hlstart :hllstart :hlend :hllend :hlsep :hlfmt :hllfmt :hfmt
            Same as above, specific for the header lines in the table.
            All lines before the first hline are treated as header.
            If any of these is not present, the data line value is used.

This may be either a string or a function of two arguments:

:efmt       Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.
            The format should have %s twice for inserting mantissa
            and exponent, for example \"%s\\\\times10^{%s}\".  This
            may also be a property list with column numbers and
            formats.  :fmt will still be applied after :efmt.

directly by `orgtbl-send-table'.  See manual.
