;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides two minor modes which automatically recompile
;; Emacs Lisp source files.  Together these modes guarantee that Emacs
;; never loads outdated byte code files.

;; `auto-compile-on-save-mode' recompiles source files when they are
;; being saved and `auto-compile-on-load-mode' does so before they are
;; being loaded.  Both modes only _recompile_ a source file when the
;; respective byte code file exists and is outdated.  Otherwise (when
;; the byte code file doesn't exist or is up-to-date) these modes do
;; _not_ compile the source file.

;; To permanently or temporarily toggle automatic compilation of some
;; source file use the command `toggle-auto-compile'.  Since the modes
;; only ever _update_ byte code files, toggling automatic compilation
;; is done simply by either creating the byte code file or removing
;; it.  `toggle-auto-compile' can also toggle automatic compilation of
;; multiple files at once; see it's doc-string for more information.

;; Even when using `auto-compile-on-save-mode' it can happen that some
;; source file is newer than the respective byte code file.  This can
;; for example happen when performing version control operations and
;; is a problem because Emacs always loads the byte code file even
;; when the respective source file has been modified since the former
;; was created.

;; To prevent outdated byte code files from being loaded
;; `auto-compile-on-load-mode' advises `require' and `load' to first
;; recompile a source file if it is newer than the respective byte
;; code file.

;; Enabling `auto-compile-on-load-mode' as early as possible reduces
;; the risk of loading an outdated byte code file.  It is best if you
;; enable both modes together at the beginning of your init file, even
;; before loading your package manager and having it initialize the
;; `load-path'.

;;     ;; -*- no-byte-compile: t -*-
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/auto-compile")
;;     (require 'auto-compile)
;;     (auto-compile-on-load-mode 1)
;;     (auto-compile-on-save-mode 1)

;; Automatically compilation of Emacs Lisp source files is useful for
;; at least the following reasons:

;; ◆ Emacs prefers the byte code file over the source file even if the
;;   former is outdated.  If you have to do the compilation manually
;;   you will at least occasionally forget to do so and end up with an
;;   old version of your code being loaded.

;; ◆ There are many otherwise fine libraries to be found on the
;;   Internet which when compiled will confront the user with a wall
;;   of compile warnings and an occasional error.  If authors are
;;   informed about these (often trivial) problems after each save
;;   they will likely fix them quite quickly.  That or they have a
;;   high noise tolerance.

;; ◆ It's often easier and less annoying to fix errors and warnings as
;;   they are introduced than to do a "let's compile today's work and
;;   see how it goes".

;; This package is designed to stay out of your way as much as it can
;; while still motivating you to get things fixed.  That might be
;; annoying initially but less so once existing problems have been
;; fixed.  By default Auto-Compile won't let you quit Emacs on the
;; first attempt without fixing fatal errors in visited source files
;; first.  To disable this set `auto-compile-mark-failed-modified' to
;; nil.

;; Also note that just because no warnings and/or errors are reported
;; when a source file is compiled by the modes defined here this does
;; not necessarily mean that users of your libraries won't see any.  A
;; likely cause for this would be that you forgot to require a feature
;; which is loaded on your system but not necessarily on the users'
;; systems.  So you should still manually compile your packages before
;; release:

(defun toggle-auto-compile (file action)
  "Toggle automatic compilation of an Emacs Lisp source file or files.

Read a file or directory name from the minibuffer defaulting to
the visited Emacs Lisp source file or `default-directory' if no
such file is being visited in the current buffer.

If the user selects a file then automatic compilation of only
that file is toggled.  Since both `auto-compile-on-save' and
`auto-compile-on-save' only ever _recompile_ byte code files,
toggling automatic compilation is done simply by creating or
removing the respective byte code file.

If the user selects a directory then automatic compilation for
multiple files is toggled as follows:

* With a positive prefix argument always compile source files;
  with a negative prefix argument always remove byte code files.

* Otherwise the existence or absence of the byte code file of
  the source file that was current when this command was invoked
  determines whether byte code files should be created or removed.

* If no Emacs Lisp source file is being visited in the buffer
  that was current when the command was invoked ask the user what
  to do.

* When _removing_ byte code files then all byte code files are
  removed.  If `auto-compile-deletes-stray-dest' is non-nil this
  even includes byte code files for which no source file exists.

* When _creating_ byte code files only do so for source files
  that are actual libraries.  Source files that provide the
  correct feature are considered to be libraries; see
  `packed-library-p'.

* Note that non-libraries can still be automatically compiled,
  you just cannot _recursively_ turn on automatic compilation
  using this command.

* When `auto-compile-toggle-recompiles' is non-nil recompile all
  affected source files even when the respective source files are
  up-to-date.  Do so even for non-library source files.

* Only enter subdirectories for which `packed-ignore-directory-p'
  returns nil; most importantly don't enter hidden directories or
  those containing a file named \".nosearch\"."
