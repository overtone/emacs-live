<p class="bluey">
<img src="images/animated-cursor.gif" width="7" height="13"/> The terminal cursor blinks at you with that friendly familar frequency. Except for this time, things are different. You paste in the following runes, follow the instructions and then launch Emacs:</p>

<p class="bluey">
<span class="orangey">
bash <(curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/overtone/emacs-live/master/installer/install-emacs-live.sh)
</span>
</p>


  <p class="bluey">
    Energy starts surging through your fingertips. Sparks fly, making
    the shadows grow and flicker ominously around you. You arch your
    back and open your eyes as if for the first time. The text appears
    more vibrant and colourful than you remember. Your fingers dance on
    the keyboard commanding the cursor with a joyful precision and
    control.
  </p>

  <p class="bluey">
    You lean back and marvel as a shimmering swirl of syntactic and
    symantic structures project out of the screen and intertwine with a
    fractal beauty. You watch as meaning recursively unfolds into deeper
    meaning live in front of your eyes. You feel a deep and lasting
    synchronicity form as the boundaries between you and your Emacs
    wash away.

    <a href="http://github.com/overtone/emacs-live" >You and your Emacs Live.</a>
  </p>


<h2>--> A curated Emacs experience</h2>
<p class="whitey">Emacs Live is a carefully curated Emacs config which transforms vanilla Emacs from simply an incredible editor into an intense experience. The key is in the curation. Unlike other exemplary Emacs config tools such as the <a href="http://overtone.github.com/emacs-live/">starter kit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a> which are very modular, Emacs Live embodies a holistic approach creating an all-round package.  We build on the shoulders of giants and incorporate many independent projects, ensuring that they all work together seemlessly.</p>


<h2>--> Programming as performance</h2>
<p class="whitey">We believe that the process of programming is best considered as a performance and Emacs Live is a tool built to explicitly support this act. We place a strong emphasis on live feedback, visual cues and creating a clean uncluttered flow-enhancing distraction-free environment. Emacs Live will make you perform whether you're hacking <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic">core.logic</a> in an office or <a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone/">overtone</a> in a nightclub.</p>


<h2>--> Perfect for Clojure hacking</h2>

<p class="whitey">Emacs Live was designed from the ground up to create an insane Clojure hacking experience. It ships with more bang than you can pack into a firework and doesn't need a safety tin: <span class="orangey">nREPL support</span>, <span class="orangey">auto completion</span> with <span class="orangey">fuzzy matching</span>, <span class="orangey">snippets</span>, <span class="orangey">docstring lookup</span>, <span class="orangey">paredit</span>, <span class="orangey">rainbow parens</span>, the famous <span class="orangey">cyberpunk colour theme</span> and many more custom modifications. All you need to do is bring along is a version of Leiningen 2.0.</p>

<h2>--> Power features</h2>
<p class="whitey">Emacs Live doesn't just excel as a Clojure hacking environment, it's an all-round text manipulation power house with a plethora of finely honed features. In addition to many custom modifications, we pack in the amazing <span class="orangey">undo-tree</span>, a <span class="orangey">visual kill-ring</span>, <span class="orangey">gist integration</span>, <span class="orangey">ace jump mode</span>, <span class="orangey">multiple cursors</span>, <span class="orangey">expand region</span>, and much, much more.</p>

<h2>--> Trivial installation</h2>
<p class="whitey">Either run the script above, or download the <a href="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live/tags">latest release</a>, rename it to <code>~/.emacs.d</code> and launch Emacs. That's all - joy awaits.</p>


<h2>--> Fully documented</h2>
<p class="whitey">Emacs Live is currently going through a Beta phase. There will be full documentation available before 1.0 is released. <a href="http://overtone.github.com/emacs-live/documentation.html">Watch this space...</a></p>
