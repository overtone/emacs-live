## 1.0-BETA-21 (Sun 3rd March 2013)

* Update many dependencies.
* Allow user to define Emacs Live root directory to a location other
  than `~/.emcs.d`. Either by setting a var called`live-root-dir` or an
  env variable called `EMACS_LIVE_DIR`.
* Clojure print enhancement - specify `*print-length*` to 100 to stop
  infinite sequences killing things.
* Monkey-patch basic-save-buffer to ask you nicely about buffers that
  don't have associated files when quitting Emacs.
* Switch to ruby-mode in .rake, .gemspec and Gemfile buffers
* Initialise mouse mode for new terminals
* Add git-gutter mode - marks the lines which are different between the
  last saved version of the buffer (not fully live) and the last
  commited version of that file in git. + denotes a new line, - for
  removed lines and ~ for modified lines. The following fns are useful:
  - C-c g g git-gutter:toggle
  - C-c g p git-gutter:previous-diff
  - C-c g n git-gutter:next-diff
  - C-c g d git-gutter:popup-diff

  `git-gutter:popup-diff` is awesome: try it on a line marked by Git
  Gutter.


## 1.0-BETA-20 (Tues 22nd Jan 2013)
* relax pack checks to not throw exceptions with invalid or absent pack metadata

* add new fn live-server-kill-terminal which allows you to make a speedy
  exit without having to save stuff.
* bindings modifications:
  - don't clobber M-\ unless in paredit-mode, when we give it more useful behaviour.
  - C-\ backward-kill-word
  - C-] kill-region
  - M-] kill-ring-save
* start working on support for pack metadata via info.el files
